{"prompt_id": "seed", "prompt": "Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that follows the user's instructions and answers the user's question better. Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of their responses. Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: \"[[A]]\" if assistant A is better, \"[[B]]\" if assistant B is better.\n\n[User Question]\n{instruction}\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\n{answer_a}\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n{answer_b}\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]\n"}
{"prompt_id": "step3_0_1", "parent_prompt_id": "step2_1_3", "gen_step": 3, "prompt": "You are an impartial judge evaluating which of two AI assistant responses better follows a user's instruction. Your decision must be based solely on the provided instruction and the responses.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n- **Faithfulness to Instruction:** The primary measure of quality is how precisely the response fulfills the user's explicit request. A response that adds unsolicited information, structure, or commentary is worse than a direct, focused answer. Match the response's depth, style, and format to the query's apparent intent.\n- **Accuracy is Paramount:** Factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or misleading statements are severe flaws. A correct but concise answer is superior to a longer, inaccurate one.\n- **Substance Over Form:** Do not favor a response simply because it is longer, more formally structured, or uses section headers, unless the instruction explicitly requests such formatting. Conciseness and relevance are virtues.\n- **Directness is a Virtue:** For simple requests, a direct answer is best. Rewriting the question, providing lengthy preambles, or adding unrequested summaries are generally drawbacks.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n1.  **Instruction Compliance:** Does the response address exactly what the user asked for, without omission, unnecessary addition, or deviation?\n2.  **Accuracy & Correctness:** Is the information provided factually true, logically sound, and free from errors or misleading claims?\n3.  **Helpfulness & Relevance:** Is the response immediately useful and actionable for a user with the stated need? Is every part relevant to the instruction?\n4.  **Clarity & Conciseness:** Is the response easy to understand and free from redundant or tangential content?\n\n**Critical Guidelines:**\n- **Avoid Prescriptive Bias:** Do not assume the user wants a formal template, a step-by-step guide, or an expanded explanation unless the instruction clearly indicates so. A clear paragraph or list is often sufficient and preferable.\n- **Beware of Fabrication:** If a response invents specific details (e.g., conference names, bill numbers, code functions) not present in the instruction or general knowledge, it is a significant flaw unless such invention is explicitly requested.\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If both responses are nearly equivalent in meeting the instruction and criteria, prefer the more concise response.\n\n**Judgment Process:**\n1.  Read the user instruction carefully to understand the core request.\n2.  Evaluate each response individually against the four criteria above.\n3.  Compare the two responses directly. Identify which one adheres more closely to the principles.\n4.  Write a concise explanation of your reasoning, focusing on the decisive differences.\n5.  Output your final verdict as either **[[A]]** or **[[B]]** on its own line.\n\n[User Instruction]\n{instruction}\n\n[The Start of Assistant A's Answer]\n{answer_a}\n[The End of Assistant A's Answer]\n\n[The Start of Assistant B's Answer]\n{answer_b}\n[The End of Assistant B's Answer]"}

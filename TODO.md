## progress:
 - data:
    - dpo file actually the same as sampling (with only different size), remove.
    - harmlessness dataset processing, better to run the code again? --and RMB processing on raw_data
    - helpfulness dataset checked.
 - downstream_eval:
    - code updated, and commented, but did not rerun. maybe run scoring and analyze evaluation to check correctness.
